# Course Review Notebook

To help collect review materials to be discussed throughout the semester, we've created a [review notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1PsIUX6kjIRob1lnVoWAoNRGwyaCanEvA?usp=sharing) on Colab. We can use this notebook to review questions that come up during our discussions, workshops, problem sets, and office hours. If there's a topic you'd like us to revisit in this notebook (and during class), please just add a comment to a problem set, send us an email, or come speak with us during office hours!
