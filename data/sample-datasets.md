# Sample Datasets

We've started a <a href='https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17Ikn50Jz80o64gOOX5vvDl1bBsCuyatneiQtKYEoaBQ/edit#gid=0' target='_blank'>spreadsheet of sample data</a> that might be helpful for experimenting with the methods we'll be covering in class. We'll keep adding to the list over the semester as we come across additional datasets.

Additionally, you might be interested in working with data Yale University Library has licensed for text and data mining research. A lot of this data will consist of periodicals that have been OCRed (with varying success) and are available as XML files. For tags you can use on Quicksearch to see what's available, visit the [Digital Humanities Lab's website](https://dhlab.yale.edu/news/2020-01-20-text-mining.html).
