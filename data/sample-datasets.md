# Sample Datasets

We've started a <a href='https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17Ikn50Jz80o64gOOX5vvDl1bBsCuyatneiQtKYEoaBQ/edit#gid=0' target='_blank'>spreadsheet of sample data</a> that might be helpful for experimenting with the methods we'll be covering in class. We'll keep adding to the list over the semester as we come across additional datasets.
