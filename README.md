### Week One: Introduction to Data Mining

In our first week of class we will discuss some of the ways researchers from the humanities and beyond have used data mining, and we will take our first steps with the Python programming language.

### Week Two: Collecting Data from APIs

In our second week of class we will take a deeper dive into data--what it is, how it's created, and how we can find and use it. In particular, we'll explore Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)--little machines that give us data to analyze!

### Week Three: Data Visualization

In our third week we will consider strategies and best practices for visualizing data that take into account what kind of data we have, who we have in mind as our audience, what story we're aiming to tell, and where we think the visualization will circulate. For Thursday's lab, please download [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/).

No Problem Set this week! Work on Project Review 1: Text Mining. You can find the prompt in Canvas under "Assignments."<br/>

### Week Four: Text Analysis: Named Entity Recognition

In our fourth week we will begin turning our attention to text analysis in more detail. In particular, we will experiment with an approach called named entity recognition, which can help us extract entities (names, locations, organizations) from text.

### Week Five: Clustering and Classification

In our fifth week we will explore supervised methods for classifying and clustering data using Python. We will consider when such approaches could be helpful, as well as what the limitations are and what kind of data we need to have.

### Week Six: Review!

In our sixth week we will review several of the programming topics we have covered so far in the semester, and we'll explore a few new topics that will prove useful as we continue our data science work in the coming weeks.

### Week Seven: Topic Modeling

In our seventh week we will learn about topic modeling by looking at case studies and experimenting with model parameters. The particular approach we'll be using is called non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), which like the classifier we trained in week five, starts with a Term-Document Matrix.

### Week Eight: Text & Image Analysis: Neural Networks

In our eighth week we will begin our transition from text mining to image mining techniques by way of neural networks. On Thursday, we will focus on word embeddings, a technique for identifying words that appear in similar contexts.

### Week Nine: Computer Vision: Color & Art

In our ninth week we will start looking more closely at image mining, with an overview of projects, techniques, and data considerations. For hands-on practice, we will experiment with color extraction.

### Week 10: Visual Similarity

In our tenth week, we will be discussing techniques for measuring and identifying image similarity. In particular, we will focus on Convolutional Neural Networks as our approach.

### Week 11: Video Analaysis

In our eleventh week, we will look at methods for video (or moving image) analysis and consider when, why, and how we might go about it. As a capstone to our image analysis module, we will learn how to train two neural networks for computer vision tasks: autoencoders and Recurrent Neural Networks.
