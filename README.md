### Week One: Introduction to Data Mining

In our first week of class we will discuss some of the ways researchers from the humanities and beyond have used data mining, and we will take our first steps with the Python programming language.

### Week Two: Collecting Data from APIs

In our second week of class we will take a deeper dive into data--what it is, how it's created, and how we can find and use it. In particular, we'll explore Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)--little machines that give us data to analyze!

### Week Three: Data Visualization

In our third week will consider strategies and best practices for visualizing data that take into account what kind of data we have, who we have in mind as our audience, what story we're aiming to tell, and where we think the visualization will circulate. For Thursday's lab, please download [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/).
